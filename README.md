Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
This repository contains code for building a Naive Bayes model to predict hotel booking cancellations. The dataset used comprises bookings due to arrive between July 1, 2015, and August 31, 2017, including both fulfilled bookings and cancellations.

Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze hotel booking data and develop a predictive model to determine whether a booking is likely to be canceled. The model will help hotel management anticipate cancellations and optimize resource allocation accordingly.

Dataset
The dataset contains various features related to hotel bookings, including customer demographics, booking details, and reservation status. Some of the key features include:

hotel: Type of hotel (Resort Hotel or City Hotel)
is_canceled: Binary value indicating if the booking was canceled (1) or not (0)
lead_time: Number of days between booking entry and arrival date
arrival_date_month: Month of arrival date
... (other relevant features)
